However, since the name doesn't directly relate to typical salon supplies, it's more likely to be categorized under a general supplies or materials category. But given the context of a salon, it's possible that ""HAN KOOK MEAT"" is actually a food purchase for employee meals or client services, which would categorize it under ""Meals and Entertainment"".
